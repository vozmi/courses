# Social Media Platform Project - Built During Next.js Full Course

This repository contains the completed project I built while taking the **Next.js - The Full Course**. The course provided an in-depth exploration of the Next.js App Router, React Server Components (RSC), and full-stack development using PostgreSQL and Prisma.

## Course Overview

During the course, I learned everything necessary to be productive with modern **Next.js**, focusing on the **App Router** introduced in version 13.2. The key topics covered include:

- **React Server Components (RSC)**: Design patterns and how to use them effectively.
- **Rendering Strategies**: How to choose the best rendering strategy for different use cases.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Best practices for organizing a project.
- **Advanced Data Fetching and Caching**: Optimizing the performance of Next.js apps.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication using **Auth.js**.
- **Data Modeling**: Working with **Postgres** and **Prisma** to manage data.
- **Migration**: How to migrate existing projects to the latest version of Next.js.

## Project Overview

As part of the course, I built a **Social Media Platform** inspired by websites like MySpace and Facebook. Key features of the project include:

- User authentication and management.
- User relationships (friending).
- Dynamic routing for profile pages.
- Data-fetching strategies for user data.
- Optimized caching and performance handling.

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with Next.js's **rendering**, **data-fetching**, and **caching** strategies.

## Features

- **React Server Components**: Practical usage of RSC for efficient rendering.
- **App Router**: Dynamic routing with Next.js 13.2 and beyond.
- **Data Management**: Postgres and Prisma for robust data handling.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with **Auth.js**.
- **Caching & Performance**: Advanced caching strategies for optimal performance.
